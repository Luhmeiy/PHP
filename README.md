# PHP

Collection of small PHP projects developed during high school at [Etec de Itanha√©m](https://www.etecitanhaem.com.br/).

## What are the projects about

### RPG-Cyberpunk

An unfinished rpg manager that would allow the game master to create classes, itens, enemies and much more and insert it dynamically into the game. It would also make it easier for the players to create their character sheets and would keep a log of the game so the players could revisit their actions in the future.

### TCC-BarricasBar

An e-commerce developed for a pub called Barrica's Bar. Through the website, clients would be able to order their food before hand, so they wouldn't need to wait in line to order in the pub.

### escolaInfantil

A website developed for a fictional school. Through the website, parents would be able to learn more about the school and the way it worked. They would also be able to see the prices of enrollment.

### gerenciadorFinanceiro

My first medium size PHP project. In this website, the user would be able to track their finances, how much they spent and how much money they have left.

### graph

A website that allows the user to compare the quotation of two currencies, in relation to the Real (BRL), through a graph. It can also be used as a converter of any of the 13 currencies provided by the Currency Quotes API, available on [AwesomeAPI](https://docs.awesomeapi.com.br/), to Brazilian Real (BRL)
